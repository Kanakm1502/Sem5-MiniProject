Steps I am Taking

1. Find  website
-- Run in terminal
2. scrapy startproject location_data
3. scrapy genspider locations traveltriangle.com
4. scrapy crawl locations
--open locations that just got created. Make sure it is in the spiders folder.
5. Take a look at the code there
6. Start finding tags and collecting data

**Remove None values from image links created due to lack of src_data field in some tags, also lazy load feature uses both src and src_data and in js src is automatically replaced with src_data after loading.

**There is trouble with collecting data for ways to reach because starting from 71. Agumbe the means of transport are no longer maintained in a list. Thus currently we have empty lists after that.
--> solved by just collecting means enclosed in enable tags and not including descriotions.

**The above discrepancy is causing problems in the rest of the code!!!

**Trouble in places to visit after Agumbe coz its all mixed in one paragraph with how to reach descriptions!!!

**Data starting from how to reach values in highly incorrrect and needs work...
